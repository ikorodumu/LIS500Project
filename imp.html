            <h2>What is Implicit Bias?</h2>
            <p>Implicit bias refers to the unconscious attitudes, stereotypes, and preferences that influence our judgments and behaviors toward others, often without our awareness. These biases are shaped by societal norms, cultural contexts, and personal experiences, and they can affect decisions in areas like hiring, education, healthcare, and social interactions. While not inherently malicious, implicit bias can perpetuate inequality and discrimination, as it leads to automatic, often unfair assumptions about people based on characteristics like race, gender, age, or appearance.</p>
            <p><strong>Why does it matter?</strong> Recognizing and addressing these biases is crucial for fostering fairness and inclusivity in everyday life. As Robin DiAngelo explains in <em>White Fragility</em>, implicit bias is deeply embedded in the fabric of society, and it requires conscious effort to unlearn these cognitive shortcuts.</p>

        <!-- Understanding the Implicit Bias Test (IBT) -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Understanding the Implicit Bias Test (IBT)</h2>
            <p>The Implicit Bias Test (IBT) reveals how we subconsciously associate positive or negative words with different images, uncovering biases shaped by societal influences like media, cultural norms, and upbringing. These biases, often unnoticed, can intersect with aspects of identity such as race, gender, or socioeconomic status, impacting experiences of discrimination.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Someone raised in a rural area might lack exposure to discussions on racism, leading to unintentional biases rooted in limited education rather than malice. While challenging and educating others is important, addressing implicit bias ultimately depends on individual willingness to recognize and unlearn these biases.</p>

        <!-- Intersectionality and Bias -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Intersectionality and Implicit Bias</h2>
            <p>Intersectionality, a term coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw, highlights how different forms of oppression (such as racism, sexism, and classism) intersect and compound in the lives of individuals. For example, a Black woman may face unique challenges that are different from those faced by a Black man or a white woman.</p>
            <p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> Understanding intersectionality helps us recognize that implicit bias doesn’t operate in isolation. It’s influenced by multiple layers of identity, and addressing it requires a nuanced approach that considers these intersections.</p>
